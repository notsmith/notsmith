**Philosophy**

```yaml
I build like an engineer, not an artist.

I don’t chase frameworks. I deploy solutions.

Simplicity is a discipline, not a lack of ambition.

Reliability beats novelty. Clean beats clever.

If it’s not testable, traceable, and explainable, it doesn’t belong in production.

I write systems that can be understood in silence.

A well-built feature is one you don’t have to talk about.

The user should feel power — not see it.

It should impress you quietly — and still work at 2 a.m.
```
